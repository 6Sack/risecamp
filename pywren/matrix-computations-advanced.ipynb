With a little work we can write a \"ShardedMatrix\" wrapper that shards numpy matrices across S3 objects (the source code for this can be found in matrix.py) This allows us to use PyWren's map functionality to access different parts of the matrix. We can further use this functionality to compute a large scale matrix multiplication.\n",
