    "This tutorial will walk you through the process of starting Clipper, creating and querying a Clipper application, and deploying models to Clipper. In the first part of the demo, you will set up Clipper and create an application without involving any machine learning, demonstrating how a frontend developer or dev-ops engineer can set up and query Clipper without having to know anything about the machine-learning models involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, this tutorial will walk you through creating an application that labels images as either pictures of birds or planes. You will use the CIFAR-10 dataset as the source of these images.\n",

    "These images have already been downloaded and are available locally at `/data/cifar`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Load Cifar\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in building any application, using machine-learning or otherwise, is to understand the application requirements. Load the dataset into the notebook so you can examine it and better understand the dataset you will be working with. The `cifar_utils` library provides several utilities for working with CIFAR data – we will make use of one of them here."

    "In order to query Clipper for predictions, you need to create an application. Each application specifies a name, the query input datatype, the selection policy, and a latency service level objective. Once you register an application with Clipper, the system will create a REST endpoint for handling prediction requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "By associating the query interface with a specific application, Clipper allows frontend developers the flexibility to have multiple applications running in the same Clipper instance. Applications can request predictions from any model in Clipper. This allows a single Clipper instance to serve multiple machine-learning applications. It also provides a convenient mechanism for beta-testing or incremental rollout by creating experimental and stable applications for the same set of queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, you will create an application named \"cifar_demo\". Note that Clipper allows you to create the application before deploying the models. Clipper will be moving to a label-based model specification mechanism soon, so that in the future you won't have to explicitly enumerate all the models you want to query up front.\n",

    "> *Don't worry if this command seems to take a long time. Before starting Clipper, the Docker containers must be downloaded from Docker Hub. These containers are fairly large and may take awhile to download depending on the speed of your internet connection.*"
